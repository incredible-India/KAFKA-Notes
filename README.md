If you want to get a deeper understanding of Kafka or how to use Kafka Stream for big data processing. I highly recommend you check out the material including some books and courses that I linked in the reference section.

Kafka introduction
The data problem
You need a way to send data to a central storage quickly
Because machines frequently fail, you also need the ability to have your data replicated, so those inevitable failures don't cause downtime and data loss
That's where Apache Kafka comes in as an effective solution. Apache Kafka is a publish-subscribe based durable messaging system developed by Linkedin.

Why use Kafka?
Multiple producers and consumers at any given time without interfering with each other. This is in contrast to many queuing system where one message is consumed by one client
Disk-Based retention:
Consumers do not always need to work in real time. Messages are commited to disk and stay for some periods of time.
There is no danger of losing data.
Fast: Kafka is a good solution for applications that require a high throughput, low latency messaging solution. Kafka can write up to 2 million requests per second
Scalable:
Expansions can be performed while the cluster is online, with no impact on the availability of the system as a whole.
High Performance: Excellent performance under high load.
Why is Kafka fast?
Zero Copy: Basically Kafka calls the OS kernel directly rather than at the application layer to move data fast.
Batch data in chunks: Kafka is all about batching the data into chunks. This minimises cross machine latency with all the buffering/copying that accompanies this.
Avoids Random Disk Access: Kafka is designed to access the disk in sequential manner. This enables it to get similar speeds from a physical disk compared with memory.
Can scale Horizontally: The ability to have thousands of partitions for a single topic spread among thousands of machines means Kafka can handle huge loads.
Compared to other message queue systems


Use Cases
Activity tracking: The original use case for Kafka, designed at LinkedIn, is that of user activity tracking.

Messaging: when applications need to send notifications to users. Those can produce messages without needing to be concerned about formatting. Then an other applicatoin can read all the messages and handle them consistently.

Metrics and logging

Commit log: Database changes can be published to Kafka and applications can easily monitor this stream to receive live updates as they happen.

Stream processing: Kafka is extremely good for streaming and processing huge datasets.

Kafka architecture
Kafka is a message broker. A broker is an intermediary that brings together two parties that don't necessarily know each other for a mutually beneficicial exchange or deal.

Log
Is a file that Kafka appends incoming records to. A log is an append-only, totally ordered sequence of records ordered by time



Configuration setting log.dir, specifies where Kafka stores log data on disk.



Topics
Topics are logs that are seperated by topic name. Thinks topics as labeled logs. The closest analogies for a topic are a database table or a folder in a filesystem.

Topic name examples:

orders
customers
paymments
To help manage the load of messages coming into a topic. Kafka use partitions

Topics are broken down into a number of partitions.

Partitions are the way that Kafka provides redundancy and scalability. Each partition can be hosted on a different server, which means that a single topic can be scaled horizontally across multiple servers.
